- **Custom Breakpoints**: Added `xs` breakpoint (475px) for extra small screens
- **Touch-Friendly Interfaces**: 
  - Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile devices
  - Touch manipulation optimization
  - Active states for better feedback
- **Safe Area Support**: Added support for device safe areas (notches, home indicators)
- **Responsive Typography**: Clamp-based fluid typography that scales with viewport
- **Mobile-Specific Improvements**:
  - Prevented iOS zoom on form inputs (16px font size)
  - Improved mobile navigation with proper touch targets
  - Landscape orientation optimizations
- **Accessibility**: Reduced motion support for users with motion sensitivity
- **Performance**: High-resolution display optimizations

### 2. Enhanced Responsive Container System

**File: `src/components/layout/responsive-container.tsx`**

- **ResponsiveContainer**: Flexible container with multiple size options and padding configurations
- **ResponsiveGrid**: Adaptive grid system with configurable columns per breakpoint
- **ResponsiveStack**: Flexible layout component that adapts orientation based on screen size
- **ResponsiveShow**: Conditional rendering based on breakpoints
- **useResponsive Hook**: Real-time breakpoint detection with SSR support
- **useMediaQuery Hook**: Custom media query hook for JavaScript-based responsive logic

### 3. Adaptive Layout Components

**File: `src/components/layout/responsive-layout.tsx`**

- **AdaptiveCard**: Cards that adapt padding and hover states based on device type
- **ResponsiveFeedLayout**: Three-column layout that collapses appropriately on smaller screens
- **ResponsiveImage**: Optimized image component with aspect ratio control
- **ResponsiveText**: Typography component with fluid sizing
- **ResponsiveButtonGroup**: Button groups that stack on mobile, row on desktop
- **ResponsiveList**: Lists with adaptive spacing and dividers

### 4. Responsive Configuration System

**File: `src/lib/responsive.ts`**

- **Centralized Breakpoints**: Consistent breakpoint definitions across the application
- **Media Query Strings**: Pre-defined media queries for JavaScript usage
- **Responsive Utilities**: Helper functions for breakpoint detection and device type checking
- **CSS Variables**: Fluid spacing and typography variables using clamp()

### 5. Updated Layout Components

**Enhanced Components:**
- **AppShell**: Added responsive padding and safe area support
- **Sidebar**: Improved touch targets, responsive spacing, and adaptive widths
- **TopBar**: Enhanced search bar sizing, touch-friendly controls, responsive spacing
- **MobileNav**: Better touch targets, landscape optimizations, improved visual feedback

- Optimized for Core Web Vitals

## ðŸ§ª Testing

A comprehensive test page has been created at `/responsive-test` that demonstrates:
- Responsive grid layouts
- Adaptive component behavior
- Breakpoint detection
- Touch-friendly interfaces
- Typography scaling
- Conditional rendering based on screen size

## ðŸ“± Device Support

The responsive design system supports:
- **Mobile Phones**: 320px - 767px
- **Tablets**: 768px - 1023px
- **Desktops**: 1024px+
- **Touch Devices**: Optimized touch targets and interactions

- **Landscape/Portrait**: Adaptive layouts for both orientations

## ðŸ”§ Usage Examples

```tsx
// Responsive Container
<ResponsiveContainer size="lg" padding="responsive">
  <content />
</ResponsiveContainer>

// Responsive Grid
<ResponsiveGrid cols={{ mobile: 1, tablet: 2, desktop: 3 }}>
  <items />
</ResponsiveGrid>

// Conditional Rendering
<ResponsiveShow above="lg">
  <DesktopOnlyContent />
</ResponsiveShow>

// Responsive Hook
const { isMobile, isTablet, isDesktop } = useResponsive()
```
